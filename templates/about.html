                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>AlphaPolyp is dedicated to improving polyp detection and measurement in endoscopy procedures through advanced artificial intelligence. Our goal is to provide healthcare professionals with accurate, real-time analysis tools that enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.</p>
                
                <h3>The Technology</h3>
                <p>Our AI model uses a custom architecture combining Residual Atrous Pyramid Units (RAPU) with a CAFormer backbone to achieve state-of-the-art polyp segmentation and volume estimation. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of endoscopy images to ensure accuracy across various clinical scenarios.</p>
